      <p>Believe in yourself</p>

      <p>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. <br>
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br>
         I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br>
         And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br>
         Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</p>

      <p>“Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. <br>
         Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. <br>
          Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.”</p>   

      <p>“Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, <br> 
        more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.”</p>    

      <p>“Live the Life of Your Dreams: <br>
         Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision <br>
          and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.”</p>  

      <p>“Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. <br> 
        There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.”</p>   
        
      <p>“Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power <br>
         over instead of craving control over what you don't.”</p>  

      <p>“Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.”</p>   

      <p>“Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.”</p>

      <p>“The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.”</p>

      <p>“Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams: <br>
         Surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams, <br>
          encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in you.”</p>

      <p>“Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. <br>
         Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. <br>
          Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.”</p>
