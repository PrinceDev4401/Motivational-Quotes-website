            <h1>MOTIVATIONAL <sub><span>QUOTES</span></sub></h1>
            <p class="word">"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. <br>
                All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.<br>
                I wake up every morning and think to myself, How far can I push this company <br>in the next 24 hours."</p>

            <p class="word">“Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”</p>    

            <p class="word">“It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.”</p>

            <p class="word">“The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, <br>
                 unless you forgive the situation, <br>
                  unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.”</p>

            <p class="word">“Success is not how high you have climbed, <br>
                 but how you make a positive difference to the world.”</p>      

            <p class="word">“Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.”</p>     

            <p class="word">“Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals.
                If you aren’t grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more.”</p>

            <p class="word">“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</p>  
            
            <p class="word">“Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.”</p>

            <p class="word">“Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.”</p>

            <p class="word">“Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.”</p>

            <p class="word">“Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness.”</p>

            <p class="word">“The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.”</p>
